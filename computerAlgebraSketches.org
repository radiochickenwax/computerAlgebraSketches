*** overview

This is a large topic to cover.  There are lots of choices to make.
There are lots of examples to pull from.  

Here are some of the first examples to come to mind. 

	- emacs calc
	  - most useful because of its integration with emacs 
	- maxima
	  - more powerful algebra than emacs calc
	  - also written in lisp
	- yacas
	  - written in C++
	- sympy
	- numpy
	- ginac
	  - written in C?
