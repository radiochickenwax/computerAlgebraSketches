*** overview

This is a large topic to cover.  There are lots of choices to make.
There are lots of examples to pull from.  

Here are some of the first examples to come to mind. 

	- emacs calc
	  - PRO: most useful because of its integration with emacs
	  - PRO: has units
	  - CON: is not really a standalone package.  Where is source
            code?  Emacs is beautiful but too complicated.  
	- maxima
	  - PRO: more powerful algebra than emacs calc
	  - NON: also written in lisp
	  - CON: huge code base
	- yacas
	  - written in C++
	- sympy
	  - PRO: standalone and pluggable
	- numpy
	  - PRO standalone and pluggable
	- ginac
	  - PRO: written in C?
	  - PRO: standalone and pluggable
	  - not much interactivity
	- see rpn calc in mlib
	-
